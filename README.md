## Bike Sharing System
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. The company wants to know:

    - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    - How well those variables describe the bike demands
## Business Goal
- The goal is to design a mulitple linear regression model about the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. This data will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. Also this model will provide a good way for the management to understand the demand dynamics of the market.
